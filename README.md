# Dragon Tower Game by Romain Carissan

## Why I chose this game?

I selected the Dragon Tower Game for its animation and collision handling, which are excellent exercises for a beginner like myself. Additionally, the game's concept is straightforward, making the logic relatively simple with no overly complex functions or algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Animation and Collision Management:** The game features a dragon animation lasting 2.6 seconds, towers appearing every 2.6 seconds, and a dragon moving at a speed of 5 to match the tower animation at 60fps.
- **Dynamic Colors:** The colors of the towers' SVG and the dragon dynamically alternate. Towers change randomly, while the dragon's colors cycle in a specific pattern.
- **Best Score Display:** The best score is prominently displayed during gameplay.
- **End Screen Variation:** The end screen varies depending on the player's score.

## What's Next?

- **Local Storage:** Implement a local storage system to store and display the best score locally.
- **Responsiveness:** Enhance the game's responsiveness to ensure a smooth experience across different devices.
- **Mobile Version:** Develop a dedicated mobile version of the game for users on smaller screens.
